Procedural music generator written in Java.
Uses the JFugue API (by David Koelle) to create (hopefully) pleasant songs through application of music theory.


Usage:

Change generation settings using the controls in the left panel

Playback controls are located beneath the phonograph
    - Pressing play will generate a new song if nothing is playing or resume playback if an existing song is paused
    - Pressing pause will stop playback of the current song. Pressing play will resume playback
    - Pressing stop will stop playback of the current song. Pressing play will generate a new song
